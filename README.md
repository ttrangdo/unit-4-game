CrystalsCollector Game

The player will have to guess the answer, just like in a Word Guess game. However, instead of the player guessing with letters, the player will guess with numbers instead.

Here's how the app works:

- There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.


The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

Each round resets with a new random number and all four crystals will have new hidden values.

Good luck!
